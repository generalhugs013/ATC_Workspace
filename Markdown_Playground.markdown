## By GeneralHugs013
### Basic Know-How
**1.** To write a how to article, you want to be very knowledgeable on the subject you're writing about. if you're not, that's alright! Read *step 2*.

**2.** If you still have a little laerning to do, that's fine! You can just ask the internet. Do some research on your chosen topic.

**3. (Alternative Step)** There's always an alternative! If you are having trouble researching for any reason, or if you just want to be lazy, just find some mumbo jumbo to write out. If people are confused, they'll pretend they aren't and think yopur article is great!

Let's choose a topic for our example article: *How to Identify the Causes of Back Pain*. Here's a list of words for back-realated stuff I found from Google. Click to see [some back-related words](https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/spine-anatomy/spinal-anatomy-and-back-pain). Here's an excerpt from an article I wrote based off of it:

*Cervical Lumbaritis is caused by inflamation in the Coccyx. The Dorsal Thoractic area is where the Vertebral Column usually rubs against, causing painful soreness and stiffness.*

You see? If you use a mix of words you know, and find some confusing ones, then add in some prefixes and suffixes, you'll be just fine.

### Anatomy of a How-To Article

**1.** The intro. Ah, yes, the most important part of a how-to article. See, when you write one, you want to convince someone that you are the best and most reliable source of info, whether that's true or not. You need to start by telling them the benefits of doing things your way:

*With GeneralHugs013's vast plethora of knowledge concerning the back and its anatomy, you can overcome back pain forever. Read this captivating article on identifying the causes of back pain, and you'll no longer have to worry about it, no matter what.*

See, all you have to do is market your article so someone will actually take the time to read it. That's the way you need to starts all articles in general.

**2.** At this point in the article, you should start either putting in either what you know about your topic, or you shouls start figuring out how to phrase the mumbo-jumbo. See my excerpt from *Basic Know-How* for an example. 

I cannot possibly convey how important it is that you eithr check multiple times to make sure that your info is COMPLETELY LEGIT, or that you use crazy or at least very ambiguous language as much as possible. If you don't take one or both of these steps, you will most likely considered a fraud.

**3.** We talked about the body of the article in the last step. This next section is technically part of the body, but it's important that you set up the body this way. As you keep writing the body of the article, it's important to consistently add more allusions each paragraph to the advantage or skill that a reader will gain from taking your advice. This keeps the reader's attention on the article. With each paragraph, you need to convince them that the best information is still to come, and they will benefit the most from reading to the end. 

The reason that this part of a how-to article needs to be talked about separately from the body of the article is that you should follow the instructions in *2* for only the first paragraph, and then it is essential that you follow the instructions in this paragraph for success. 

**4.** An observant reader may have noticed by now that my primary concern as far as writing these how-to articles is people who aren't particularly knowledgeable on the subjects they are writing on. Well, my advivce on the body of the article for more honest folks is that you write up some relevant information, focusing on one subtopic per paragrah. A common format for these more reliable articles is five-paragraph.

**5.** 

**6.** The last part of any good article, no matter what type or relevancy, is the conclusion. This is the point in the article where you start wrapping up with your article. One strategy I would like to suggest before we move on, is referencing another article in the end of yours. Another of your articles, obviously, because it's bad to give your competitors backlinks. Here's an example from my artcle on back pain:

*In short, there are many parts of the back that can contribute to back pain.
